## Autoresearch Addition
## Risk Management Rules
- Only take directional positions (conviction >70) when multiple confirming signals align
- Use conviction bands: 30-50 (small position), 50-70 (medium), 70+ (large, requires 3+ confirming factors)
- Avoid opposing EM positions simultaneously unless clearly different time horizons
- Default to NEUTRAL when cross-currents exist (e.g., China stimulus vs USD strength)
